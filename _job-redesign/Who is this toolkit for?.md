This toolkit has been developed based on a 6-month work trial conducted in 2021, featuring 27 role holders who took on the Community Care Associate and Senior Community Care Associate role. Expansion of the redesigned roles continued in 2022, with a further 259 role holders (and counting) taking on the roles, across 7 CCOs in both the Nursing Home and Senior Care Centre setting.

The toolkit includes the findings from our study, a step-by-step guide on how to implement the roles in your own organisation, as well as key learnings and case studies from CCOs who have trialled the roles.
