**In order to successfully conduct Job Redesign and introduce the new roles at your CCO, we would recommend having the following set up:**

Need help with the sections

**Strong buy-in from:**

*   Senior leadership (e.g. CEO, Nursing Leaders, HR Director)
*   Key stakeholders (e.g. Clinical, Therapy, Process Improvement, Training teams)

**Clear business objectives and a desire to:**

*   Enhance the care model to provide personalised, multi-disciplinary, holistic care

Setting clear business objectives and having strong buy-in from stakeholders will help your project team to make decisions which may require trade-offs along the implementation journey.
