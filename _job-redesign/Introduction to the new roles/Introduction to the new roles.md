##### Introduction to the new roles


Insert image

These job roles were developed using existing junior care roles as a foundation, such as the Healthcare Assistant (HCA) and Nursing Aide (NA), with a focus on the following principles:

*   Increasing productivity and efficiency
*   Improving senior experience
*   Enhancing value of jobs

Within the roles of the HCA and NA, we identified manual, time-consuming, and suboptimal tasks that could be streamlined or eliminated through process redesign or technology integration. These solutions can be found in the **Getting Started > Recommended Solution** section of this toolkit.

Additionally, we examined tasks performed by other related roles, namely the Therapy Aide (TA) and Enrolled Nurse (EN).

By first deconstructing the HCA and NA role, identifying tasks for redeployment and then reconstructing into a new job, we were able to create blended support care roles – the Community Care Associate and Senior Community Care Associate.
