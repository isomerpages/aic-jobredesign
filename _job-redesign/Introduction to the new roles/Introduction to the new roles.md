##### Introduction to the new roles


Insert image

These job roles were developed using existing junior care roles as a foundation, such as the Healthcare Assistant (HCA) and Nursing Aide (NA), with a focus on the following principles:

*   Increasing productivity and efficiency
*   Improving senior experience
*   Enhancing value of jobs

Within the roles of the HCA and NA, we identified manual, time-consuming, and suboptimal tasks that could be streamlined or eliminated through process redesign or technology integration. These solutions can be found in the **Getting Started > Recommended Solution** section of this toolkit.

Additionally, we examined tasks performed by other related roles, namely the Therapy Aide (TA) and Enrolled Nurse (EN).

By first deconstructing the HCA and NA role, identifying tasks for redeployment and then reconstructing into a new job, we were able to create blended support care roles – the Community Care Associate and Senior Community Care Associate.

With the "table formatting", suggest combine the following block of text and image and upload as 1 image.

*   The project team conducted a review of the proportion of time spent on various tasks by Junior Care Roles
*   The team then reviewed tasks that are manual, time-consuming and sub-optimal that can be streamlined and/or eliminated through process redesign, technology enablement and/or regulation review.
*   Adjacent roles such as the Therapy Aide and Enrolled Nurse were also reviewed to identify tasks that could potentially be  decanted and performed by the Junior Care Role, in the development of a redesigned support care role

**QUICK TIP:** Given the foundation of the roles, they typically work alongside the Therapy Aides and Enrolled Nurses, and are suitable for HCA and NA role holders who desire an enriched role with a greater impact to holistic care.

Junior care roles, such as the HCA and NA, attend to patients' daily living needs and perform basic patient care procedures under the supervision of trained nurses.

Through our study of the HCA/NA role, we identified tasks that took up a large proportion of time. Examples of these tasks included:

*   Manual and time-consuming showers, diaper checks and changes
*   Manual and physically strenuous transfers
*   Manual and double-documentation of vital sign taking and other documentation
*   Housekeeping tasks

Time spent on these areas were reduced with the use of technology and though outsourcing to other roles. This allowed the new roles, the Community Care Associate (CCA) and Senior Community Care Associate (SCCA), to take on enhanced care tasks.

**Details on new roles created:**

Through our study and external research, we identified areas where basic clinical and therapy care could be integrated, as highlighted in the boxes on the right. These, together with the existing HCA / NA tasks, were used to build the CCA role.

The role of the Community Care Associate (CCA) is to provide quality daily living care, in line with the sector’s aim to provide Singapore’s elderly with a dignified life. The CCA works together with Clinical and Therapy teams to promote the maintenance of elders’ independent living skills, through holistic care.

The Job Description of a CCA can be found **here**.

Senior Community Care Associate (SCCA)

In addition to the tasks of the CCA, the SCCA is required to complete more advanced clinical and rehabilitative tasks as well as provide administrative and operational support to supervisors.

The role of the Senior Community Care Associate (SCCA) is to provide quality day-to-day daily living care for the elders, to and promote independent living skills. They also ensure the smooth implementation of new operational procedures.
